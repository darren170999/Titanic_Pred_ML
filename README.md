# Titanic_Pred_ML
This repository displays the use of Machine Learning to predict the survivability of passengers aboard the Titanic. This project was for a module that i took in my second year as an Engineering student. Many models were included but none were used elaborately. Feature engineering and selection techniques such as ANOVA were the highlight of the project.
